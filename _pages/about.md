Welcome to my website. 
I am a PhD student and Research Associate in Economics at the University of Göttingen, working at the intersection of empirical macroeconomics and applied time‑series analysis. My research focuses on global macro‑financial linkages, Euro area output gaps, and the identification of spillovers in structural VAR models. I approach these questions using Bayesian time‑series methods, including the development of priors for BVARs, dynamic factor models and FAVARs, and the Bayesian estimation of linear and nonlinear state‑space models.
