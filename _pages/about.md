Welcome to my website.
I am a PhD student and Research Associate in Economics at the University of Göttingen, working at the intersection of empirical macroeconomics and applied time‑series analysis. My research focuses on global macro‑financial linkages, Euro area output gaps, and the identification of spillovers in structural VAR models. I approach these questions using Bayesian time‑series methods, including the development of priors for BVARs, dynamic factor models and FAVARs, and the Bayesian estimation of linear and nonlinear state‑space models.

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
